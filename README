 FAQ
----

F1. Bicho crashed with 'UnicodeEncodeError' exception

UnicodeEncodeError appears when it is not possible to write the data in the
database with the encoding used by this one, to avoid that set your database to
use UTF-8. For instance:

CREATE DATABASE [DB NAME] CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci;

F2. What is the database schema?

There is a nice PNG schema in the directory /doc/database

F3. How can I create a new backend?

Tell us through the contact information above that you want to create a new
backend, we'll try to give you as much information as possible.

F4. How can I submit a bug?

Use our bugzilla at http://bugzilla.libresoft.es/
