1.- About Bicho:
		-------------

Bicho is a Bug Tracker System Analyzer. It extracts information about bugs,
such as: ID, priority, resolution, status, comments, descriptions,
changes, attachments and so on. It then puts them in a database in order to
let you use that information to study and analyze it.

Bicho is capable of analyzing the following BTSes (Bug Tracker Systems):

* Apache
* Bugzilla
* SourceForge (Allura)
* Redmine
* GitHub
* Google Code (out-of-date)
* JIRA
* Launchpad




2.- Requirements:
		--------------

Bicho needs some libraries, such as:

* Storm: Storm is an object-relational mapper (ORM) for Python
  developed at Canonical. The project was in development for more than a
  year for use in Canonical projects such as Launchpad and Landscape
  before being released as free software on July 9th, 2007
  (https://storm.canonical.com/)

* Beautiful Soup: Beautiful Soup is a Python HTML/XML parser designed for
  quick turnaround projects like screen-scraping
  (http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/)

* Python (>2.6)
* python-mysqldb

$ apt-get install BeautifulSoup

or

$ easy_install BeautifulSoup

or

$ pip install BeautifulSoup

Step 4: Test it

Options:

   -h, --helpPrint this usage message.
   -t, --type           Type optionsf bug tracking system (sf|bg)
SourceForge or Bugzilla
   -p, --pathPath where downloaded URLs will be stored (/tmp/bicho/)

        Database input parameteres are required.



4.- Usage:
		-------

As you can see, if you execute "bicho --help" command, Bicho has several
parameters. This section is aimed to show you how to use Bicho to
analyze a Bugzilla BTS or a SourceForge BTS.

Analyzing a Bugzilla BTS:

NOTE: It is important to note that you have to create an empty database that
Bicho is going to use before executing the application.

$ mysqladmin -uuser -ppassword create database_name

$ bicho -t bg --db-user_out="user" --db-password_out="password"
--db-database_out="database_name" "URL_project_BTS"

Analyzing a SourceForge BTS:

NOTE: It is important to note that you have to create an empty database that
Bicho is going to use before executing the application.

$ mysqladmin -uuser -ppassword create database_name

$ bicho -t sf --db-user_out="user" --db-password_out="password"
--db-database_out="database_name" "URL_project_BTS"
