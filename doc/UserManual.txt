1.- About Bicho :
		-------------

Bicho is a Bug Tracker System Analyzer, it extracts bug's information
such as : id, priority, resolution, status, comments, descriptions,
changes, attachments and so on and put them in a database in order to

* Apache
* Bugzilla
* SourceForge



2.- Requirements :

		-------

As you can see, if you execute "bicho --help" command, Bicho has several
parameters, this section is aimed to show you how to use Bicho to
analyze a Bugzilla and SourceForge BTS.

Analyzing a Bugzilla BTS :

NOTE : It is important to note that you have to create an empty database that
Bicho is going to use before execute the application.

$ mysqladmin -uuser -ppassword create database_name

$ bicho -t bg --db-user_out="user" --db-password_out="password"
--db-database_out="database_name" URL_project_BTS

Analyzing a SourceForge BTS :

NOTE : It is important to note that you have to create an empty database that
Bicho is going to use before execute the application.

$ mysqladmin -uuser -ppassword create database_name

$ bicho -t sf --db-user_out="user" --db-password_out="password"
--db-database_out="database_name" URL_project_BTS
